This paper addresses the evidence review in the available literature regarding the benefits of pandemic apps. The first perspective is taken from the scientists' point of view, i.e., what aspects are important to scientists in terms of pandemic app support in a pandemic situation? The second perspective is to represent the users of such a pandemic app, what is already technically and socially accepted or how has this changed due to the pandemic situation? The last position is to integrate the legal faction, which deals with the question of which facts are permissible under which conditions and whether novel paths may have to be taken for pandemic apps.
