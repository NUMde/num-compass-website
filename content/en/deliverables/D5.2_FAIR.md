The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles were described in March 2016 in the journal Scientific Data by a consortium of scientists and organizations, and were supplemented and updated in 2018. The main idea of the FAIR principles is to focus on the machine usability of data as the volume and complexity of data continues to increase.
