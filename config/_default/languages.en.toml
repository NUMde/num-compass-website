But for apps to be effective in a pandemic, they must be used by many people. This is not only true for the Corona-Warn-App, but especially for apps for the assessment of individual risk, e.g. in case of certain pre-existing conditions. It is therefore essential that such apps enjoy the trust of the general population and that data for medical research can be evaluated together with the consent of the users."
